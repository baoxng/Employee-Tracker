# Employee-Tracker

## Description
In this application I wanted to develop an employee tracking database with just using MySQL. With this simple database users can view and add department, roles, and employees in addition to updating an employee role. 

## Getting Started

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

## Installation

To install all necessary materials for this project, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Reference
Here is a [Demo](https://youtu.be/IW4cigqDlXs) of the application. 


## Usage

Be sure to install all node modules and packages locally before using the application.
